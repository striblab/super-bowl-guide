That’s why apps and maps are available, as well as platoons of people who can point you in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Here’s what you need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many skyways will have extended hours of operation, especially if they are linked to specific Super Bowl events.

The soft, egg-enriched bun is a beauty, and garnishes are kept to a well-edited minimum: perky pickle chips and a prodigious amount of white American cheese.
