I grew up in the Southwest, but have lived here for 30 years, which means I’m about halfway toward honorary native status. I love it here. I cherish the endless summer nights. I heard my first loon Up North. Became a biking enthusiast, and a year-round runner, too, because there are a gazillion miles of well-tended lake paths and 40 brands of long underwear.</p>\n<p>But certain things still set me apart.</p>\n<p><strong>The Twin Thing.</strong> I live in Minneapolis, but travel to St. Paul a lot, for work and pleasure. This sets me apart from natives. Yes, you are correct. This is the other twin in the Twin Cities. But these two are more like fraternal than identical. Loyalties are divided, and roads are not crossed. I mean this literally. People who have lived in Minneapolis or St. Paul their entire lives have never visited the other city. The marvelous new Light Rail Green Line is changing that, as are intrepid millennials and transplants from bigger cities. That St. Paul is becoming a foodie capital to rival its bigger sibling is kind of cool, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Stoic stock.</strong> Minnesotans are cautious around strangers, low-key and unassuming. Basically, stuff I’m not. I’m loud. I touch people when I talk to them and I like to stand close. I’m guessing many Minnesotans take a nap, and an Excedrin, after an hour with me. After 30 minutes with me. After …</p>\n<p><strong>Cabin culture.</strong> Coming from New Mexico, the only people I heard of who lived in cabins ended up on the front page of the Albuquerque Journal bearded and shackled. Going to a Minnesota cabin sounded like taking oneself hostage: crazy traffic jams out of the city on Friday afternoons, another house with sewer problems, two mortgages, sand in your shoes and on your floor, ducks quacking at the crack of dawn. Who needed this torture? Turns out, most Minnesotans need it. Escaping to the cabin, away from the noise and nonsense, is one of the great traditions, and gifts, of living here. I’d be invited more if I weren’t, well, see Stoic Stock above.</p>\n<p><strong>L is for lutefisk.</strong> Eww. This white gelatinous fish is a mainstay of Nordic countries, made from aged stockfish or dried and salted whitefish and lye. I once eagerly signed up to join friends for a dinner of lutefisk, confusing it with another Northern ‘L’ staple, lefse, which is soft, Norwegian flatbread. Didn’t touch the stuff. Give me white gelatinous gefilte fish any day and yes, I know I’m a hypocrite. For more hilarity on this, see “Lutefisk or Gefilte Fish?” on a site appropriately titled the Survivalist Forum.</p>\n<p><strong>Sentence structure.</strong> Call me high maintenance, but I like my sentences complete. It took me a while to realize that “Are you coming with?” was all that a Minnesotan was going to string together. Minnesota-speak also includes “hot dish” (No! It’s casserole) and “Duck, duck, gray duck” (No! It’s goose). Despite these egregious missteps, they have among the highest high school graduation rates in the country. You betcha.</p>\n","groups":["recswnFVKnnbz1aLH"],"byline":"Gail Rosenblum","twitterShare":"5 clues I’m not a Minnesotan","facebookTitle":"5 clues I’m not a Minnesotan","schemaType":"Article","imageDescription":"Walking in snow-covered forest","airtableId":"recpXTX7d8M6ezmJ1"},{"id":"tour-food","name":"Food","mainImage":[{"id":"attiNIx1sqqXj5alj","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/nvDolsxuSLqPCpYYD8vZ_foodtour.jpg","filename":"foodtour.jpg","size":2212919,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/eUeNhZ73RYCQcU5fEey8_small_foodtour.jpg","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/SwwI7moSgy9TPpeINCCH_large_foodtour.jpg","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/KRJmW6AQ6c7mHOpNayKA_full_foodtour.jpg","width":1654,"height":1240}}}],"mainImageLocal":"assets/images/airtable/tour-food.jpg","imageCredit":"Marlin Levison","description":"<p>Think of the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.tastetwincities.com\" >Taste Twin Cities</a>  tour of eateries in northeast Minneapolis and the riverfront as a gastronomic challenge.

(Come on, it’s a joke.)</p>\n<p>One result is that Minnesota’s culture is rooted in and challenged by a sense of reserve, and a slightly perverse philosophy: We’re not for everyone.</p>\n<p>Our immense Minnesota State Fair retains the trappings of a county exposition — and nobody else enshrines dairy princesses in blocks of butter. The Guthrie Theater is a regional gem. The Mall of America is the biggest shopping complex in the U.S. The Minnesota Orchestra has an international reputation.</p>\n<p>We vote like it matters, our 75 percent rate leading the nation.</p>\n<p>Our culture binds generations, notably in how passionately Minnesotans love their cabins. On average, people own them for 24 years, a span among the highest in the U.S. for seasonal homes. Great-grandchildren marvel at knotty pine walls.</p>\n<p>Our culture also is wet, for many of those cabins are “up at the lake.” And while we’re known as the Land of 10,000 lakes, there actually are 11,842.</p>\n<p>Our culture lauds reading, with both Minneapolis and St. Paul in the top 10 of America’s most literate cities. Yet we must be honest: That’s partly due to our arguable isolation, and our manifest winters.</p>\n<p>We write, too. Think F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ole Rolvaag, Laura Ingalls Wilder, Garrison Keillor, Louise Erdrich, Robert Bly. Now a raft of fine young authors is championed by local presses with national reputations.</p>\n<p>Our culture also includes Minnesotans who have made our population more diverse over generations.</p>\n<p>Native Dakota and Ojibwe tribes saw French voyageurs come ashore, explorers arrive from the east, and European immigrants fence the prairie. The Hmong were crucial allies in the Vietnam War. Somalis fled civil war to settle here; Rep. Ilhan Omar is now the nation’s first Somali-American legislator.</p>\n<p>Yet we’re not very diverse. Of 5.3 million residents, more than 4.5 million are white. Divisions among races ebb and flow, as do the tensions between rural and urban.</p>\n<p>Still, here we are, a progressive state known for its myths — for Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox, for Rocky and Bullwinkle, for Lake Wobegon.</p>\n<p>We are by the shores of Gitche Gumee. We are the state of hockey (and the State High School All-Hockey Hair Team). We are the Star of the North.</p>\n<p>And we like it here.</p>\n","groups":["recswnFVKnnbz1aLH"],"byline":"Kim Ode","twitterShare":"Why we love being Minnesotan","facebookTitle":"Why we love being Minnesotan","schemaType":"Article","imageDescription":"Downtown Minneapolis skyline","airtableId":"recPa1bxCHFs3UR65"},{"id":"souvenirs-mug","name":"Mug from Red Wing Stoneware & Pottery","mainImage":[{"id":"att7PrrXjjyT9bf0p","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9ae1fa6339f40e8c9002cdea1b1ae092/77a12029/souvenirs-mug.jpg","filename":"souvenirs-mug.jpg","size":2455255,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7d8dd688d2dab4096a3f480aea244e5c/8dc81eb0","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a9472a402fdacd7105ced442810a044f/9ea43901","width":682,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9915bddc52c63d923b26dde156fd9bfb/0c7334a7","width":2138,"height":1604}}}],"mainImageLocal":"assets/images/airtable/souvenirs-mug.jpg","phone":"(651) 388-4610","website":"http://redwingstoneware.com","address":"4909 Moundview Dr., Red Wing","imageCredit":"Star Tribune staff","description":"<p>The town of Red Wing was built on clay-rich land, and has a lengthy history of pottery and stoneware.

He proposed combining Mni, a rough translation from Dakota for “water,” and “polis,” which is Greek for “city.” He may have considered pitching “Hoagburg,” but thought better of it.</p>\n<p>The faces on the clock in Minneapolis’ City Hall — the big, green-roofed tower downtown — are bigger than the faces on the Great Clock in London, where Big Ben tolls the hours. No one believes us, but it’s true.</p>\n<p>Until the 1930s, Minneapolis was known as the “Flour Capital of the World” (or, more informally, “Mill City”). There are still remnants and ruins of flour-milling plants along the Mississippi River downtown today.</p>\n<p>We were also a candy capital: Mars, the company behind the Milky Way, was founded in Minneapolis in 1920. The light fluffy white confection in a Three Musketeers was once called “Minneapolis Nougat.” </p>\n<p>In Prohibition days, St. Paul was a favored hangout by gangsters, thanks to politicians and police chiefs who accepted some long green to look the other way. Dillinger, Capone, Alvin “Creepy” Karpis  — they all cooled off in St. Paul. It kept crime low, since they had to promise to do their business elsewhere. (Like Minneapolis.)</p>\n<p>If you flew into town, you trod the same ground as Dean Martin, Burt Lancaster and Jacqueline Bisset. The 1970 movie “Airport” was filmed at MSP, back when there was only one terminal, which was named for homeboy Charles Lindbergh. (Locals still use the old names for Terminal 1 and Terminal 2, the latter of which was named after Hubert H. Humphrey, a Minnesota senator and the 38th vice president.)</p>\n<p>Minneapolis’ first skyscraper, the Fo­shay Tower, was once the tallest building between Chicago and the Pacific Ocean. It’s now dwarfed by other skyscrapers, but you can still see its name in lights at night. (Incidentally, the man responsible for the eponymous building, Wilbur Foshay, was convicted of fraud in 1932. FDR commuted his sentence; Truman gave him a full pardon.)</p>\n<p>Hennepin Avenue, a street known for its theaters, restaurants and bars, was, unlikely enough, named after Father Louis Hennepin, a Franciscan missionary and early explorer. Not sure what he’d think of his street these days. </p>\n<p>In the Commons, the park outside the U.S. Bank Stadium, there’s a block of stone that reads “1947.” It’s not accompanied by any explanation. But insiders know the site was once occupied by the Star Tribune building and that 1947 was one of the years the oft-redesigned building was redesigned.</p>\n<p>Minneapolis and St. Paul, like any siblings, have had feuds over the years. The Minnesota Twins, for example, were so named to avoid irritating either city. St. Paul thinks Minneapolis is glitz-addled and boastful; Minneapolis thinks St. Paul is stodgy and unnavigable. The biggest brouhaha was in 1890, when the census riled up the locals; each city accused the other of padding the numbers. Most of the hard feelings about that have subsided, but you never know. Best you don’t bring it up.</p>\n","groups":["recswnFVKnnbz1aLH"],"byline":"James Lileks","twitterShare":"Fun facts every person should know about the Twin Cities","facebookTitle":"Fun facts every person should know about the Twin Cities","schemaType":"Article","imageDescription":"3rd Avenue bridge and snowing","airtableId":"recmpEMvlUdUxmSa0"},{"id":"moafood-twincitygrill","name":"Twin City Grill","mainImage":[{"id":"attVgyXCZRF4NKuzW","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/Uupo3SJRv6QKA2ppbKpA_1005127833%20Twin%20City%20Grill_2.jpg","filename":"1005127833 Twin City Grill_2.jpg","size":1475129,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/6wSfOniXTpKhfMG2f2mH_small_1005127833%20Twin%20City%20Grill_2.jpg","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/QmIehUTos0C28RlcEhAX_large_1005127833%20Twin%20City%20Grill_2.jpg","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/KKEX6CliSGSnNVitldXA_full_1005127833%20Twin%20City%20Grill_2.jpg","width":2547,"height":1910}}}],"mainImageLocal":"assets/images/airtable/moafood-twincitygrill.jpg","phone":"(952) 854-0200","website":"twincitygrillrestaurant.com","address":"130 North Garden, Bloomington","imageCredit":"Bre McGee","description":"<p>When the mall opened in 1992, Chicago-based Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises was there with its Tucci Benucch, a red-sauce Italian joint (which closes for good on Feb. 4).

If you want to outfit yourself for a Minnesota winter, you can choose from among North Face, Columbia, Timberland, Arc’teryx and Swedish retailer <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://fjallraven.us\" >Fjallraven</a> (2912 Hennepin Av. S., 612-252-4704). Calhoun Square mall, just blocks from the city’s prized Chain of Lakes, is home to the acclaimed <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://kitchenwindow.com\" >Kitchen Window</a> (3001 Hennepin Av. S., 612-824-4417), with specialty items and classes for gourmets and chefs-in-the-making.</p>\n<p><strong>Eat and drink:</strong> Get your drink on in the club-like <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://chinolatino.com\" >Chino Latino</a> (2916 Hennepin Av. S., 612-824-7878), which is a best bet for groups. Portions of the Asian- and Latin-fusion cuisine are large and meant for sharing. For a quieter dining spot, head to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://amazingthailandusa.com\" >Amazing Thailand</a> (3024 Hennepin Av. S., 612-822-5588). The dimly lit, colorfully decorated restaurant serves up a can’t-miss Panang curry. For dessert, try the mango with sticky rice.</p>\n","latitude":"44.948361","longitude":"-93.298278","groups":["recbhI5Jnj8Y1LTPT"],"byline":" Allie Shah","twitterShare":"Twin Cities shopping guide: Even as it changes, Uptown still a huge draw","directionsAddress":"W Lake St & Hennepin Ave Minneapolis, MN 55408","facebookTitle":"Twin Cities shopping guide: Even as it changes, Uptown still a huge draw","schemaType":"Place","imageDescription":"Outside Arc'teryx","airtableId":"recbciD5YOai94iLa"},{"id":"true-mn-glossary","name":"Use this English-Minnesotan dictionary when you’re in the Land of Lakes","mainImage":[{"id":"attmav1qrOqD3hqt2","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/4gul44ucRVywh94orU64_hotdish.jpg","filename":"hotdish.jpg","size":1808685,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/K6ZKHLBxSC8CUZOgLfb2_small_hotdish.jpg","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/an39vuYwTGqIpMLqY4aq_large_hotdish.jpg","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/CK5KKHSkRsaZJhBN5cMy_full_hotdish.jpg","width":1577,"height":1183}}}],"mainImageLocal":"assets/images/airtable/true-mn-glossary.jpg","imageCredit":"Star Tribune file","description":"<p>Just remember this: If someone asks if you want to “come with,” you reply, “You bet.”</p>\n<p>See? It’s not like Minnesota is a foreign country with its own language. All of our words are English — they just sometimes are in an unconventional order or mean something you don’t expect.</p>\n<p>Take bars. While the current hoopla has you thinking about places with ales and IPAs, here bars also mean small squares of pastry, often cakelike, sometimes topped with streusel, but always baked in a 9-by-13-inch pan. A mainstay of potlucks.</p>\n<p>Here are a few other terms to make your stay here a hoot (which is what we call a fun time).</p>\n<p><strong>The Cities:</strong> Where you are now. It’s the blanket term for Minneapolis and St. Paul, although it often describes the entire metro area. And yes, despite the “the,” we know there are more cities in the world than ours. Still, ours are pretty good.</p>\n<p><strong>Fish house:</strong> A small building with trapdoors in the floor, dragged onto a frozen lake for shelter while fishing through a hole drilled into the ice. There’s always cold beer and sometimes people even fish.</p>\n<p><strong>Hot dish:</strong> A mélange of vegetables and meat, traditionally bound by cream of mushroom soup and glorified with Tater Tots. Often called a casserole in less literal states. A mainstay of potlucks (pictured above).</p>\n<p><strong>Minnesota Nice:</strong> A complex term. It’s a spirit of genuine goodwill, i.e., having jumper cables in the trunk so you’ll always be able to help. But it’s also an emotional reserve that, while unfailingly polite, keeps folks at a distance. Some equate this with passive-aggressiveness, which just goes to show you can’t please everyone, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Lutefisk:</strong> Dried cod reconstituted in lye. A Scandinavian food that is rarely consumed in Scandinavia anymore. Minnesotans, however, have church suppers devoted to the stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>Supper:</strong> The evening meal which, elsewhere, is called dinner. (Dinner is what many rural Minnesotans call lunch.) Its usage is waning, however, mostly because all the kids are moving to the Cities.</p>\n<p><strong>That’s interesting:</strong> An all-purpose response, especially if you don’t understand or (let’s be frank) like what’s just been said. See: Minnesota Nice.</p>\n<p><strong>Uff da:</strong> An expression of dismay, disbelief, weariness or exasperation. If someone says this to you, don’t take it personally. Just nod and respond, “You bet.”</p>\n","groups":["recswnFVKnnbz1aLH"],"byline":"Kim Ode","twitterShare":"Beyond ‘You betcha’: How to speak like a true Minnesotan","facebookTitle":"Beyond ‘You betcha’: How to speak like a true Minnesotan","schemaType":"Article","imageDescription":"Minnesotan hot dish","airtableId":"recH9MK3eNspnjvOM"},{"id":"indoor-skydiving","name":"Virtual sky diving","mainImage":[{"id":"attMrfjBaIq1znW4k","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7d6ff99224d758920c629d43e5cb7d1e/b93dbccd/indoor-skydiving.jpg","filename":"indoor-skydiving.jpg","size":2334271,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ebd755c5f431657e169ee6dc2af40df7/3fb151e6","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/82ebb426528a4b5d990e8493f92a8643/c23da9a4","width":683,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2132d0b24b95f105cdd35d8e2d88cf56/36b05e9e","width":3000,"height":2250}}}],"mainImageLocal":"assets/images/airtable/indoor-skydiving.jpg","phone":"(612) 444-4359","website":"http://iflyworld.com/minneapolis","address":"12415 Wayzata Blvd., Minnetonka","imageCredit":"Anthony Souffle","description":"<p>On one hand, you don’t get that awesome bird’s eye view.
