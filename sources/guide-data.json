The first level of South Avenue has several high-end shops, like Henri Bendel, Stuart Weitzman and Burberry. East Broadway’s first level is for sports fans: <a href=\"goldyslockerroom.com\">Hockey Minnesota</a> has Wild and Gophers paraphernalia, and the <a href=\"vikingsfanshop.com\">Vikings Locker Room</a> is your shop for Super Bowl LII tees and pennants. </p>\n<p>The third level of West Market includes Minnesota-themed shops for purchasing a stuffed moose or Minnetonka moccasins. And Rybicki (952-854-3330, rybickicheese4u.com), a shop devoted to our neighboring state, stocks Packers gear and foam cheese heads, and ample samples of cheddar. Head over to Old Vine Wine and Spirits to buy a bottle from local distilleries and you’ll have the makings of your own happy hour (952-858-8800, facebook.com/OldVineWineSpirits). </p>\n<p>Some unique mall finds include: Faribault Woolen Mills (1-888-850-1865, faribaultmill.com), with blankets from the Minnesota-based legacy company; Greater Good (612-524-6830, greatergood.com), a crafts and trinkets shop that benefits charities for breast cancer, literacy and more; and Five Below (952-854-5340, fivebelow.com), for discount-seekers. </p>\n<p>If you’re looking to kill time or distract children, the mall’s got you covered. Mini-golf, maze games and escape rooms abound on the third floor, and a smaller fourth level houses a comedy club and virtual reality arcade. Sea Life Aquarium (952-883-0202, visitsealife.com) gives guests hands-on access to starfish and other creatures in a touch tank. Crayola Experience (952-851-5800, crayolaexperience.com) lets kids draw on the walls. </p>\n<p>It doesn’t take much work to find whatever Mall of America experience you are looking for.
